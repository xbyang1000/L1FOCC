# L1-FOCC: Fast One-Class Classification Using L1-norm
L1-norm based one-class SVM

The data used in the manuscript can be found here, including public and our own images and videos.
We also provide a demo code for L1-OCSVM, which has been tested on MATLAB 2017b, Windows 7 operating system.
For more UAV-based high-quality forestry image, e.g., at the size of 2400*2840, and high-resolution figures, can be avaiable at https://pan.baidu.com/s/14N29M5AMFioLEm6csxDpiw?pwd=ubt2, with the extracted code: ubt2, due to the limitation of 20MB file size.
